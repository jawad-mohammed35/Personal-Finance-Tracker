I developed a Personal Finance Tracker as my first self-project. I developed this during the summer of 2024 during my freetime. 
Prior to this project, I didn't know much of Python and SQL, so this project defiently helped me in learning those skills.

About this app:
A robust and user-friendly Personal Finance Tracker web application designed to help users manage their income, expenses, and budgeting efficiently.

Key Features:
• User Authentication: Secure login and registration functionality to ensure user data privacy.
• Transaction Management: Add, update, and delete income and expense entries with ease and export to Excel spreadsheet.
• Categorization: Categorize transactions into categories such as food, transport, bills, etc.
• Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize financial data and track spending habits.
• Multilingual Support: Switch interface between 6 different languages.
• Theme Switching: Toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized user experience.

For those who want to edit/add on to this project please do so but let me know and give me credit.

Thank you for reading up to here.
